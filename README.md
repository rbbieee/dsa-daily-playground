# DSA Daily Playground

This repository is used as a personal learning space for practicing data structures and algorithms using Python.

The main goal of this project is not to create the most optimized solutions, but to build a strong understanding of basic concepts through small and consistent practice.

Most of the materials here are written as Jupyter notebooks.
